This project implements and verifies a 2x2 AXI Interconnect using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). The interconnect allows two AXI masters to communicate with two AXI slaves, supporting burst transactions, arbitration, and address decoding. The UVM-based testbench includes AXI master/slave agents, random and directed test sequences, functional coverage, and protocol assertions to ensure compliance. The repository contains the RTL design, UVM testbench, simulation scripts, and coverage reports
